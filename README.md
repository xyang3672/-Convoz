# Problem
During Zoom meetings, especially ones that require discussions, it is important that everyone gets a chance to speak and feel like their thoughts are heard. Many times, during the meeting, someone may overpower the meeting and talk the whole time. Other times, there might be a lot of interruptions when two people are talking. Once these meetings are over, people do not take time to improve their discussion skills or get any feedback on how they did in the meeting.

# Solution
We will develop a software system that targets the transcript of each meeting. Through sentiment analysis and machine learning, we will identify and classify different behaviors during the Zoom meeting and generate statistics that provide comprehensive feedback to the individuals and the host. 

Possible statistics we collect may include blatant insults, racial slurs, any targets towards certain demographics, cutting off a person repeatedly, overly negative attitude, such as repetitive, unnecessary negative comments. We will also provide positive feedback such as healthy conversation and appropriate participation to encourage such behaviors. 
Using that information, we will analyze the transcript of the meetings. Then our program will send a comprehensive report back to each participant via email or web application, quoting things that may have sounded negative, and overall how friendly the meeting was. 

The host will be able to enable or disable the feature and the software will be activated only if the host allows. We will provide a compiled information of each individual to the host, allowing the host to view an overall performance during the meeting. However, each individual will only see his or her statistics to protect privacy.
